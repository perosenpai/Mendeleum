# Mendeleum
The game with the title "Mendeleum - Little Rescuer" is a single-player game with a top-down view. It is a serious game, aimed at education, whose goal is Creating basic chemical elements and Revisiting chemical elements.

The game takes place in a laboratory. Overall, the player solves several situations. At the beginning of the game, several chemical molecules will be generated for the player in one of the three rooms. As soon as the player picks up a given molecule, it will be added to their inventory. Then, using a microscope, they can begin to combine and create chemical elements. To create an element, the player must move the molecule with the mouse to any field. An element will be considered assembled if the correct molecules are in the fields and in the correct order. The elements needed to assemble can be displayed by the player on a list located near the blackboard. The player can proceed to the second room after completing all tasks. The rooms are divided according to states of matter. The first represents liquids, the second gases, and the third solids.

I don't take all the credit for this game. Our team had three members, each with a vital role in its development. The Scrum Master organized tasks and guided us in creating the game. The art designer crafted the visual look of the game, making it appealing. My part was to build the game's features, add animations, and include sound effects.
